    /* 

    React is front end Javascript framework which is called Javascript

    library created by facebook.

    this library creates a virtual DOM in memory , where it does all the  necessary
    manipulating before making the changes in the DOM browser.

    React finds out what changes is needed , and it changes only that needs to be changed.

    what is JSX?

    Any code which appears like HTML and is written inside Javascript is JSX code.  

    JSX allows us to write HTML elements in Javascript and place them in a DOM.

    It converts HTML tags into react elements.

    with JSX we can write expressions inside {} curly braces

    the expressions can be property or any valid  Javascript expressions, JSX

    will execute and return the result.

    what is virtual DOM?

    Virtual Dom in React is the virtual representation of RealDOM
    
    React JS uses virtualDom as a strategy to compute minimal DOM  operations
    when rendering the UI.

    React update the state changes in Virtual DOM first and then it sync with
    Real DOM.

    we can , think virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine and it can
    do changes in the blueprint but those changes will not  directly apply to 
    the machine.

    React maintains 2 virtual DOMs, one with the updated state Virtual DOM and
    other with previous state Virtual DOM.

    VirtualDOM in React uses to optimize the performance of  application.

    In React we are using JSX which should not be implemented directly by
    browsers , but instead requires a compiler to transform it into ECMAScript,
    this is where Babel comes in and act as compiler.

    Babel is a transpiler which allows us to use future Javascript in todays
    browser which can convert latest version of javascript code into the one
    that browser understands.
